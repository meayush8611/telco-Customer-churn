# telco-Customer-churn
                       **Project discription **
This project aims to predict customer churn in a telecom company using a machine learning approach.Churn prediction helps the company identify customers who are likely to leave the service,predicting measures to improve customer retention.The model uses various cutomer-related features,succh as tenure ,internet service type,and the presence of multiple lines to predict whether a customer will churn.
                  **Installation and Running the project**
Python 3.6 or higher
Jupyter Notebook (optional ,but recommended for interactive exploration)
                 **How to take insights from the Project**
(i)Data Exploration:
Use the provided Jupyter Notebook to understand the dataset,visualize distributions,and inspect relationships between features and churn.
(ii)Model Training:
The notebook guides you through the process of data preprocessing,feature engineering,and model training using a Random Forest Algorithm.
(iii)Evaluation:
Evaluate the model's performance using the classification report and other metrics provided in the notebook.
(iv)Prediction:
Use the trained model to predict churn on new customer data .Load the model and input new data to get churn predictions .
                              **Key Insights**
(a) Tenure Distribution:
   (i)High churn observed in early tenure.
   (ii)Decreasing churn rate as tenure increases.
   (iii)Low Churn for long -Term customers.
(b) Internet Service Distribution:
   (i)Most customers use fiber optic,followed by DSL and no internet service
   (ii)Fiber optic users higher churn rates.
(c) Churn by Multiple Lines and Internet Services:
   (i)Higher churn for fiber optics users,regardless for multiple lines.
   (ii)Low churn for customers with DSL and those without internet service.
